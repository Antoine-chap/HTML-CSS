                <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face.<br> From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems.<br> Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.</p>
    
                <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain.<br> Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.<br> Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message.<br> That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes.<br> That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example.<br> If we mis translate the message, our reality changes.<br> If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.<br> Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.</p>
    
                <p> They’re proofs to that.<br> Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine.<br> Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.<br> But the person is the same, you just changed your mind.<br> Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.<br> That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”<br> The farmer said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”<br> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”<br> The farmer again said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”</p>
    
                    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.<br> The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”<br> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br> Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”</p>
                </div>

                <blockquote>
    
                    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad.<br>Because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>
