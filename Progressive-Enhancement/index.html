                <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face.<br> From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems.<br> Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.</p>

                <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain.<br> Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.<br> Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message.<br> That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes.<br> That’s possible because our perception is <strong>limited</strong> : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example.<br> If we mis translate the message, our reality changes.<br> If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.<br> Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.</p>

                <p> They’re proofs to that.<br> Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine.<br> Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.<br> But the person is the same, you just changed your mind.<br> Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.</p>

                    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.<br> That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <em class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</em><br> The farmer said, <em class="old-farmer">“Is it <strong class="good">good?</strong> Is it <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”</em><br> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <em class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</em><br> The farmer again said, <em class="old-farmer">“Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”</em></p>

                    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.<br> The neighbors then said, <em class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,”</em> and the farmer responded, <em class="old-farmer">“Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”</em><br> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br> Again all the neighbors came around and said, <em class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</em> Again, he said, <em class="old-farmer">“Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.”</em></p>

                <blockquote>

                    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of <strong>immense complexity</strong>, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong>.<br>Because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.</p>
